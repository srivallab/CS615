7 OSI Layers




IPv4 is 32 bits

    ex. 11111111 00000000 11110000 00001111




Each IPv4 consists of 4 octets.




IPv4 address are divided into 2 parts:

    Network part

    Host part




Hosts on the same domain can talk to each other without a router.




Five classes of IPv4 networks:  Class A,B,C,D,E




First address on the subnet= Network address

Last address on the subnet= Broadcast address




The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) oversees global IP address/AS number allocation,root zone management etc.




IPv4 address space depletion is a major worry as more and more devices are added.




IPv6 are 128 bits

i.e. 2^128 addresses




Representation: 8x16 bit fields (words) in case insensitive colon hexadecimalrepresentation.

    ex. 2031:0000:0000:030F:0000:0000:0000:130B




You need brackets to distinguish a port from an address:

    IPv4:66.163.162.9:22

    IPv6:[2001:470:1f07:3d1::1]:22




Traceroute is used to find the path the packet takes.




Ethernet is a layer 2 protocol - Data Link layer.




tcpdump requires super-user privileges.
