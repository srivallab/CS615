Lecture 2

All computer systems require some way to store data permanently; even so-called “diskless” systems do require access to certain files in order to boot, run and be useful. Albeit stored remotely (or in memory).




More and more files have moved to the cloud.




Available storage space is a scarce resource.




Direct Attached Storage:

    Most common way to access storage.

    Hard-drives are connected directly to the server, the operating system detects the blocks and maintains a file system




Network attached storage:

    One host functions as the file server.

    Multiple clients access the file system.




Cloud Storage:

Individual disks are connected to the server using a Host Bus Adapter (HBA) using a single data/control cable and a power cable.




The traditional interfaces are SCSI, SATA, PATA and Fibre Channel.




The ways in which we combine and divide disks have implications on system performance and data redundancy.
