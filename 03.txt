Lecture 3




System administrators routinely set up new systems, create new services, and need to be able to fine-tune software from the very lowest layers.




Some systems are driven by their own firmware like RAID controller or Fibre Channel HBA.




Every sys-admin has a preferred operating system which is a result of years of experience and familiarity.




One of the most common service a sys-admin can be incharge of is a HTTP server




Boot process might include the following steps:

    Power-On Self Test(POST)

    Execution of Primary boot loader

    Access of the MBR

    Execution of secondary or second-stage boot loader.

    loading of the hypervisor and starting of the privileged doamin (dom0)

    etc.




We can define the kernel as the central component of the operating system in charge of process-, device- and memory management, facilitating access to the hardware via a small number of system calls.
